## Reason For Creation

When working with various types of video files for personal projects, the process of creating a new video element to test if a video files works keeps occurring, to speed up the process of testing the creation of this repository was created by allowing an individual to view .mp4, .m3u8 or .mpd files from a simple URL link.

## How WatchVideoByLink Works

WatchVideoByLink takes a public video URL link and display the video in a custom video player depending on the video type, WatchVideoByLink currently supports video/mp4 (MP4), application/x-mpegURL (HLS) or application/dash+xml (MPEG-DASH) URL Links, Automatic video type is also available but works a little bit differently as the system will try to get a video type and video link from the provided URL link.

Inside each video player there are diffrent features which makes the watching experience an enjoyable process but what video/mp4 (MP4) and application/x-mpegURL (HLS) have in common is the ability to download/record the provided video for as long of a video duration that the user wants provided by how long the original video is.

After the downloaded/recorded video has finish downloading, snapshots of the video in different locations will be taken (create thumbnails) and once everything is done the video will be found available in /saved/videos with features to make it easy to identify which video is which (sorted from newest to oldest).
