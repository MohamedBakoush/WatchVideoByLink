## Why WatchVideoByLink?

There are a variety of video-sharing platforms such as Vimeo (https://vimeo.com/), Gofile (https://gofile.io/), and Youtube (www.youtube.com). These platforms are used for sharing and consuming videos in their own ecosystems. However, all these video sharing platforms lack an essential feature: the ability to organise various videos found on the internet in one location under a topic for ease of consumption or future use. WatchVideoByLink was created to fill this gap.

The majority of these platforms have options to download videos for later offline use. Still, one canâ€™t necessarily share these videos offline without uploading a pre-recorded video to an online storage service that has video sharing capability, such as Google Drive (www.google.com/drive/), Dropbox (www.dropbox.com), and Mega (www.mega.io).

This process is time-consuming and annoying if needed to be done more then once due to the time to download and upload a video and the steps required to complete the tasks is significant.

WatchVideoByLink is designed to make downloading and sharing videos on the internet a seamless experience.
